# 🙋‍♂️ Name Submission Web App

This is a simple website where people can type their name and submit it. All names are saved in your browser (no internet needed). You can also see the list of all submitted names on another page.

## 🔧 What This Project Has

- A page to **type and submit names**

## ☁️ Google Cloud Services Used

This project uses 4 Google Cloud services:

1. **Cloud Storage** – To host the website (index.html, names.html)
2. **Cloud CDN** – To make the website load faster
3. **IAM (Identity and Access Management)** – To manage who can view or edit the bucket
4. **Cloud Logging** – To track access and errors (optional but helpful)

Everything is hosted using GCP in a static and fast way!
